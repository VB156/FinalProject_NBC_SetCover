# Vertex Graph Junction Generator

This Python project processes Boolean CNF formulas in DIMACS format to generate an NBC-compatible output file containing all the necessary network-based computation (NBC) data required to solve the given problem.

## Project Structure

```
├── VertexCover.py           # Main script that reads DIMACS, computes junctions, and saves output
├── VertexGraph1.dimacs      # Sample DIMACS input file
└── output.txt               # Example output file generated by VertexCover.py
```

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Place your DIMACS CNF file in the same directory (a sample file `VertexGraph1.dimacs` is provided).
3. Run the program:

```bash
python VertexCover.py
```
4. The results will be saved in `output.txt`.


## Example Output (`output.txt`)

```
12 + 8 + 7 + 2 + 1
[x,y] in [[0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1], ..., [18, 18]]
[x,y] in [[9, 7], [8, 7], ..., [18, 15]]
```

- **Header line**: Dimension of the NBC based on the given problem
- **Second line**: List of computed split junctions.
- **Third line**: List of reset-false junctions.

## DIMACS File Format

This tool expects a valid `.dimacs` file in CNF form. The format must contain:
- A header line beginning with `p cnf <num_vars> <num_clauses>`
- Clauses represented as space-separated integers ending with `0`

Example:
```
p cnf 5 3
1 -3 0
2 3 -1 0
4 -5 0
```
